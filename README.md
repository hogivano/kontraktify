# Nuxt3 Boilerplate with Vite, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Tailwind CSS, Docker

This is a boilerplate for starting Nuxt3 projects with Vite, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Tailwind CSS, Docker, and custom composable utilities for API handling (`useApi`) and metadata management (`useMeta`).

## Features

- **Vite**: Utilize the fast build tool for web development.
- **TypeScript**: Write safer and more maintainable code with TypeScript.
- **ESLint & Prettier**: Maintain code quality and consistency with ESLint and Prettier.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Rapidly build custom user interfaces with Tailwind CSS.
- **Docker**: Containerize your application for easy deployment and scalability.
- **Custom Composables**: Simplify API handling and metadata management with custom composable utilities like `useApi` and `useMeta`.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher but LTS v20.11 recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager (pnpm recommended)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (if you plan to use Docker for containerization)

## Custom Composables
This boilerplate includes custom composable utilities for simplifying common tasks:

- `useApi`: Provides utilities for handling API requests.
- `useMeta`: Manages metadata for pages, such as title, description, and other SEO-related attributes.
Feel free to extend these utilities or add your own custom composable functions as needed.

## Configuration
- __ESLint & Prettier__: Configuration files for ESLint and Prettier can be found in the project root.
- __Tailwind CSS__: Customize Tailwind CSS settings in the tailwind.config.js file.
